# ev_community_portal Internship Project
This is an internship project that I created to apply for a position at EV Buddy (Klick Capital LLC). I forked their example code and used it as a starting off point. 
It is a demo of a social web portal in which users can register/login, post messages and/or links, upvote and downvote posts, and look at posts from everyone in a central feed.
There is also an option to access admin permissions and delete posts.
###PASSWORD FOR ADMIN IS 'password123'
